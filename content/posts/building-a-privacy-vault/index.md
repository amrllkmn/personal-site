I'm building a weightlifting logging app. For the first iteration, here are some things I want to do:

- As a user, I can create a workout
- As a user, I can see reps/weight/volume/sets of the workout I created
- As a user, I can see how I'm improving through the data collected.
- As a user, I can only see my data and no one else

I'm also planning to work on the UI to be **mobile-friendly**. Here's [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/amrllkmn/one-more-set).

Well, that's about it. 👋🏽 See you on the next one.
